# Gabbro-CE

## DEPRECATED
I have since integrated this repo into my homelab IaC environment: https://gitlab.com/haondt/deployments

This is the cloud environment (CE) for Gabbro, my home server. The intent is for this to offer all the infrastructural applications required to deploy applications on my "working" server (e.g. secret management, automation, etc).

The following subdomains need to be mapped in dns

- `portainer.gabbro-ce`
- `gsm.gabbro-ce`
